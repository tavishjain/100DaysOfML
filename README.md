# 100DaysOfML
This repository contains all the codes and history of what I did during the 100DaysOfML challenge
100DaysOfML is a challenge wherein I publicly commit to spend atleast 1 hour solving Machine Learning problems

# Day 1 - 1st January 2019
Started off with the challenge and uploaded all the previously completed content

# Day 2 - 2nd January 2019
Learned python basics 

# Day 3 - 3rd January 2019
Learned about Multi-class classification 

# Day 4 - 4th January 2019
Learned about Neural Networks

# Day 5 - 5th January 2019
Learned more about Neural Networks, their cost functions, backpropogation algorithm and random initialisation

# Day 6 - 6th January 2019
Learned about Neural Network's Implementations and implemented the basic cost function for it (regularised and non-regularised)

# Day 7 - 7th January 2019
Learned about the Backpropogation algorithm in Neural Networks, Gradient checks and Random initialisation

# Day 8 - 8th January 2019
Implemented the Backpropogation algorithm for neural networks, along with the gradient checks

# Day 9 - 15th January 2019
Learnt about Evaluating hypothesis, dividing our data into train, test and validation formats and Bias vs Variance
